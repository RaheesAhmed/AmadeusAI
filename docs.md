Docx files
The DocxLoader allows you to extract text data from Microsoft Word documents. It supports both the modern .docx format and the legacy .doc format. Depending on the file type, additional dependencies are required.

Setup
To use DocxLoader, you'll need the @langchain/community integration along with either mammoth or word-extractor package:

mammoth: For processing .docx files.
word-extractor: For handling .doc files.
Installation
For .docx Files
npm
Yarn
pnpm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core mammoth

For .doc Files
npm
Yarn
pnpm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core word-extractor

Usage
Loading .docx Files
For .docx files, there is no need to explicitly specify any parameters when initializing the loader:

import { DocxLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/docx";

const loader = new DocxLoader(
  "src/document_loaders/tests/example_data/attention.docx"
);

const docs = await loader.load();

Loading .doc Files
For .doc files, you must explicitly specify the type as doc when initializing the loader:

import { DocxLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/docx";

const loader = new DocxLoader(
  "src/document_loaders/tests/example_data/attention.doc",
  {
    type: "doc",
  }
);

const docs = await loader.load();

Usage, custom pdfjs build
By default we use the pdfjs build bundled with pdf-parse, which is compatible with most environments, including Node.js and modern browsers. If you want to use a more recent version of pdfjs-dist or if you want to use a custom build of pdfjs-dist, you can do so by providing a custom pdfjs function that returns a promise that resolves to the PDFJS object.

In the following example we use the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù (see pdfjs docs) build of pdfjs-dist, which includes several polyfills not included in the default build.

npm
yarn
pnpm
npm i pdfjs-dist

import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const customBuildLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  // you may need to add `.then(m => m.default)` to the end of the import
  pdfjs: () => import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js"),
});

Eliminating extra spaces
PDFs come in many varieties, which makes reading them a challenge. The loader parses individual text elements and joins them together with a space by default, but if you are seeing excessive spaces, this may not be the desired behavior. In that case, you can override the separator with an empty string like this:

import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const noExtraSpacesLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  parsedItemSeparator: "",
});

const noExtraSpacesDocs = await noExtraSpacesLoader.load();
console.log(noExtraSpacesDocs[0].pageContent.slice(100, 250));

This example goes over how to load data from CSV files. The second argument is the column name to extract from the CSV file. One document will be created for each row in the CSV file. When column is not specified, each row is converted into a key/value pair with each key/value pair outputted to a new line in the document‚Äôs pageContent. When column is specified, one document is created for each row, and the value of the specified column is used as the document‚Äôs pageContent.

---------------------------------------
JSON files
The JSON loader use JSON pointer to target keys in your JSON files you want to target.

No JSON pointer example
The most simple way of using it, is to specify no JSON pointer. The loader will load all strings it finds in the JSON object.

Example JSON file:

{
  "texts": ["This is a sentence.", "This is another sentence."]
}

Example code:

import { JSONLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";

const loader = new JSONLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.json");

const docs = await loader.load();
/*
[
  Document {
    "metadata": {
      "blobType": "application/json",
      "line": 1,
      "source": "blob",
    },
    "pageContent": "This is a sentence.",
  },
  Document {
    "metadata": {
      "blobType": "application/json",
      "line": 2,
      "source": "blob",
    },
    "pageContent": "This is another sentence.",
  },
]
*/

Using JSON pointer example
You can do a more advanced scenario by choosing which keys in your JSON object you want to extract string from.

In this example, we want to only extract information from "from" and "surname" entries.

{
  "1": {
    "body": "BD 2023 SUMMER",
    "from": "LinkedIn Job",
    "labels": ["IMPORTANT", "CATEGORY_UPDATES", "INBOX"]
  },
  "2": {
    "body": "Intern, Treasury and other roles are available",
    "from": "LinkedIn Job2",
    "labels": ["IMPORTANT"],
    "other": {
      "name": "plop",
      "surname": "bob"
    }
  }
}

Example code:

import { JSONLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";

const loader = new JSONLoader(
  "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.json",
  ["/from", "/surname"]
);

const docs = await loader.load();
/*

    "metadata": {

SupabaseVectorStore
Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative. Supabase is built on top of PostgreSQL, which offers strong SQL querying capabilities and enables a simple interface with already-existing tools and frameworks.

LangChain.js supports using a Supabase Postgres database as a vector store, using the pgvector extension. Refer to the Supabase blog post for more information.

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with Supabase vector stores. For detailed documentation of all SupabaseVectorStore features and configurations head to the API reference.

Overview
Integration details
Class	Package	PY support	Package latest
SupabaseVectorStore	@langchain/community	‚úÖ	NPM - Version
Setup
To use Supabase vector stores, you‚Äôll need to set up a Supabase database and install the @langchain/community integration package. You‚Äôll also need to install the official @supabase/supabase-js SDK as a peer dependency.

This guide will also use OpenAI embeddings, which require you to install the @langchain/openai integration package. You can also use other supported embeddings models if you wish.

tip
See this section for general instructions on installing integration packages.

npm
yarn
pnpm
npm i @langchain/community @langchain/core @supabase/supabase-js @langchain/openai

Once you‚Äôve created a database, run the following SQL to set up pgvector and create the necessary table and functions:

-- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors
create extension vector;

-- Create a table to store your documents
create table documents (
  id bigserial primary key,
  content text, -- corresponds to Document.pageContent
  metadata jsonb, -- corresponds to Document.metadata
  embedding vector(1536) -- 1536 works for OpenAI embeddings, change if needed
);

-- Create a function to search for documents
create function match_documents (
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  match_count int DEFAULT null,
  filter jsonb DEFAULT '{}'
) returns table (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  embedding jsonb,
  similarity float
)
language plpgsql
as $$
#variable_conflict use_column
begin
  return query
  select
    id,
    content,
    metadata,
    (embedding::text)::jsonb as embedding,
    1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  from documents
  where metadata @> filter
  order by documents.embedding <=> query_embedding
  limit match_count;
end;
$$;

Credentials
Once you‚Äôve done this set the SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY and SUPABASE_URL environment variables:

process.env.SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY = "your-api-key";
process.env.SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-db-url";

If you are using OpenAI embeddings for this guide, you‚Äôll need to set your OpenAI key as well:

process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your LangSmith API key by uncommenting below:

// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"

Instantiation
import { SupabaseVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/supabase";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  model: "text-embedding-3-small",
});

const supabaseClient = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY
);

const vectorStore = new SupabaseVectorStore(embeddings, {
  client: supabaseClient,
  tableName: "documents",
  queryName: "match_documents",
});

Manage vector store
Add items to vector store
import type { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const document1: Document = {
  pageContent: "The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" },
};

const document2: Document = {
  pageContent: "Buildings are made out of brick",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" },
};

const document3: Document = {
  pageContent: "Mitochondria are made out of lipids",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" },
};

const document4: Document = {
  pageContent: "The 2024 Olympics are in Paris",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" },
};

const documents = [document1, document2, document3, document4];

await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents, { ids: ["1", "2", "3", "4"] });

[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

Delete items from vector store
await vectorStore.delete({ ids: ["4"] });

Query vector store
Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added you will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent.

Query directly
Performing a simple similarity search can be done as follows:

const filter = { source: "https://example.com" };

const similaritySearchResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
  "biology",
  2,
  filter
);

for (const doc of similaritySearchResults) {
  console.log(`* ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata, null)}]`);
}

* The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]

If you want to execute a similarity search and receive the corresponding scores you can run:

const similaritySearchWithScoreResults =
  await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore("biology", 2, filter);

for (const [doc, score] of similaritySearchWithScoreResults) {
  console.log(
    `* [SIM=${score.toFixed(3)}] ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(
      doc.metadata
    )}]`
  );
}

* [SIM=0.165] The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* [SIM=0.148] Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]

Metadata Query Builder Filtering
You can also use query builder-style filtering similar to how the Supabase JavaScript library works instead of passing an object. Note that since most of the filter properties are in the metadata column, you need to use arrow operators (-> for integer or ->> for text) as defined in Postgrest API documentation and specify the data type of the property (e.g. the column should look something like metadata->some_int_prop_name::int).

import { SupabaseFilterRPCCall } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/supabase";

const funcFilter: SupabaseFilterRPCCall = (rpc) =>
  rpc.filter("metadata->>source", "eq", "https://example.com");

const funcFilterSearchResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
  "biology",
  2,
  funcFilter
);

for (const doc of funcFilterSearchResults) {
  console.log(`* ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata, null)}]`);
}

* The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]

Query by turning into retriever
You can also transform the vector store into a retriever for easier usage in your chains.

const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever({
  // Optional filter
  filter: filter,
  k: 2,
});
await retriever.invoke("biology");

[
  Document {
    pageContent: 'The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: 'Mitochondria are made out of lipids',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  }
]
